# OurEDA-S2L
It will be use on the new robot of OurEDA, which is the simplified version of planned S2.That's why it's called S2L.
For now,it has the basic function--just to move.Some others has been added but no one could test it,so I disabled them.
It may be completed next month,when I can test the machine myself.
